## Project description üìã

This project implements real-time object detection using the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** model, an advanced algorithm that applies deep learning techniques to object detection. YOLO uses **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** to identify and localise objects in images or videos. Developed in Python, the solution uses the **ultralytics** library to run the YOLO model and **OpenCV *(cv2)*** for video capture and image processing.

**OpenCV** is an open-source computer vision library offering a wide range of functions and algorithms for image and video processing. In the context of YOLO, OpenCV is used to handle input images, perform pre-processing, and visually display object detections on the output.

## Project structure üìÇ

The project consists of the following files:

- ``data/``: Folder containing the video downloaded from [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) for object detection.
- ``img/``: Folder containing images for the project.
- ``coordinates.py``: Python script to manually define a polygon within the capture and get the coordinates to use in the *detect.py* script. A count of the objects within the defined polygon is performed. *[Code source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy8uRDZw8pk&t=20s)*
- ``detect.py``: Python script for object detection and YOLOv5 model inference, using the pre-trained file *yolov5n.pt*.
- ``yolov5n.pt``: Pre-trained YOLO model used for object detection.

## Project aim üéØ

The goal of this project is to process the video, detect objects using the YOLO model (focusing on cars and buses), draw bounding boxes and labels for each detected object, and display these on the screen. Additionally, it counts the number of cars and buses entering a specified bounded polygon in real time.

## Running instructions üíª

To run this project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository on your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running ``pip install opencv-python torch numpy matplotlib``.
3. Make sure you have the data folder and the YOLO model *(yolov5n.pt)* in the same environment as the python scripts. 
4. Run the *coordinates.py* script (run in the terminal: ``python coordinates.py``) and click on the video to draw a polygon.
5. Run the *detect.py* script (run in the terminal: ``python detect.py``).
6. Press ‚Äòq‚Äô to close the video and stop the execution.
7. The video will appear showing the bounding boxes of the detected objects, their scores and the counting inside the polygon.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

![PyTorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-EE4C2C?style=for-the-badge&logo=pytorch&logoColor=white)

The deep learning framework used to load and utilize the YOLOv5 model. It‚Äôs specifically used here through the torch.hub.load method to obtain the YOLOv5 model.

![YOLOv5](https://img.shields.io/badge/YOLOv5-FF6F00?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)

A popular object detection model that is used for detecting and classifying objects in images or video frames. In this code, the yolov5n variant ``(YOLOv5 Nano)`` is employed, which is a lightweight version of YOLOv5.

![OpenCV](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenCV-5C3EE8?style=for-the-badge&logo=opencv&logoColor=white)

An open-source computer vision and machine learning library used for video handling, image processing, and visualizations. It‚Äôs used here for operations such as reading video frames ``(cv2.VideoCapture)``, drawing bounding boxes ``(cv2.rectangle)``, placing text ``(cv2.putText)``, and displaying images ``(cv2.imshow)``.

### To do ‚öôÔ∏è

- [ ] **Train the YOLOv5 model with newly tagged (annotated) images**. This involves providing the model with a dataset of images in which objects of interest are labelled, so that YOLOv5 can learn how to recognise these objects in unseen data.
