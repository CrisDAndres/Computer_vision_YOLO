## Project description ðŸ“‹

This project implements real-time object detection using the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** model, an advanced algorithm that applies deep learning techniques to object detection. YOLO uses **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** to identify and localise objects in images or videos. Developed in Python, the solution uses the **ultralytics** library to run the YOLO model and **OpenCV (cv2)** for video capture and image processing.

OpenCV is an open-source computer vision library offering a wide range of functions and algorithms for image and video processing. In the context of YOLO, OpenCV is used to handle input images, perform pre-processing, and visually display object detections on the output.
